The website was for young adults that were going to select the property where they will live the rest of their lives, and people that will become their close contacts, or a property for investment purposes. All of this drove my attention to two things, trust, and a casual feeling."

            <p class="lato-regular-me big-text-content-font-2">
                Young adults were not going to enjoy the experience too much if the website looked too formal or old fashioned. And they wouldn’t feel convinced about committing to the website if they didn’t feel safe or at ease given the highly important actions that they would be taking there.

                <p class="lato-regular-me linejump">
                    So I looked for inspiration in different websites targeted for young adults. I decided to use a lot of white space to generate a feeling of relaxation, and I followed color psychology recommendations by using blue to generate trust. Also, I chose a thick font for a feeling of safety, a feeling of being holding onto something robust, firm, and confident that wouldn’t let you down.

                <p class="lato-regular-me linejump">
                    I set blue, black, and white as the main colors, and I offered various color palette options with other secondary colors to choose from. Orange because it represents affordability, and purple because it matches with blue and represents luxury.

                    And I created a second version where the Teams section wouldn’t be divided in two, it would be a general Teams section to give users the freedom of using the team however they wanted instead of constraining them with two options (Living and Investing). I decided to give this recommendation because it would simplify the visuals and it would probably unlock other use cases that we couldn’t see but users could, thus making the website more capable of retaining users.

                    During brainstorming, the ideas that were more prominent were about showing the “For Living” and “For Investing” terms first in the homepage, and having the search filters and properties listing somewhere there too. We discussed where to place the search filters and whether or not to include the explainer diagram.
                </p>
                <p class="lato-regular-me linejump">
                    At the end, we decided to place the filters in the middle of the page, and we included the diagram in an overlay that would slide in once the user hovered over informational cards that would be placed randomly in the properties listing through AI. We also decided to use colors to differentiate the two main terms of the page.

                    With half the work done, I implemented the homepage following the sketches and the UI style guide. For the colors I did the following:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="newright">
                <div class="bulletsblack">

                        <span class="lato-black">Black for Living</span> because the majority of the users will be young adults looking for a house, and white text on black background drives more the attention due to the higher contrast, thus making things easier for the majority of users

                <div class="bulletsblack">

                        <span class="lato-black mainblue">Blue for Investing</span> because the rest of the users would be the investors so the other main color was assigned to them
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="bulletsblack">

                        <span class="lato-black mainpurple">Purple for Teams</span> because Teams is a completely different entity so it needs a different color. Purple was chosen above orange (the other secondary color) because it kept a good balance, orange made things look too festive, and stakeholders were okay with including this color contrary to the initial idea of just using blue, black, and white because they saw the need for it
                    </p>

                <p class="lato-regular-me linejump">
                    But to my surprise, there was still a lot of feedback. Probably some stakeholders changed their minds, but the requests were to remove the “For Living” and “For Investing” buttons and to include them in the search filters so the properties could be categorized with these terms as well, not just the teams, and the way of doing that would be with tags. And to remove the properties images from the top altogether.

                    <p class="lato-regular-me">
                        I changed the background color of the filters section because it had a tone of blue that looked off because it was not used anywhere else.

                    In the properties cards I removed the Ratings and Likes, I had added them because I was following models and examples but when I analyzed carefully I noticed that they were not really needed in this app. What was added to replace them was the Favorites icon (the star) which suits better the needs of this app. The Target button was added to allow users to target or associate properties with their teams. The For Living or For Investing tags were moved to the top because they are more important, and the colors were changed to avoid mistaking them for buttons. Other text was changed from blue to black to avoid mistaking them for links as well, and Search Tags were added because they were considered appropriate for helping users find what they need, they were placed at the bottom.

                    In the Teams cards I added the For Living and For Investing tags at the top and with the appropriate colors as well because they were missing in the previous version. I also replaced the Likes icon with the Favorites icon. The Search Tags were already present so they were kept, and the Description section was shortened to allow more space for other important details at the top that were not considered before. These details were the Spots Left, meaning the number of users that the team is willing to accept, and the Target Properties, meaning the properties that the team wants to buy. The number of Spots Left were highlighted with a reddish orange tone since it's an essential piece of information that users should know.

                    The Users cards were not created during the making of the Homepage, so they were done directly in this part of the work, but since they have less information they were easier to design. They had the Favorites icon, the name of the user, the For Living or For Investing tag, the Team to which the user belonged if any, and his/her Favorite Properties if any. All of this at the top because it was the most important information. Below was an Intro describing the user, and the Search Tags at the end.
